# Game List

Game List is my first public website that I created using Next.js. It allows you to search for and view information about video games, such as screenshots, descriptions, and ratings. Admittedly, the code is not the cleanest and the commits are not very detailed or helpful. I learned a lot from this project though, and I plan on recreating it from scratch one day.
